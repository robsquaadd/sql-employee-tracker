# sql-employee-tracker

# Description

This is an application that allows users to perform a wide variety of operations to their employee database. Users can view employees, view by specific criteria such as department, view departments, view roles, add roles, departments, and employees, delete roles, departments, and employees, and update an employee's role.

When the application is started the user is presented with a main menu with all of the different options that they can choose from. When the user chooses an option they may be asked a few questions. For example, to add an employee the user will be asked for the employee's first and last name, their role and their manager.

Once the user answers the questions, then a SQL query will run to make the correct modifications to the database. The user will get confirmation at the end that the query was run correctly.

Future areas of development are as follows:
-- handle deletions more smoothly
-- allow users to update an employee's manager
-- allow users to calculate a departments expenses.
